arduino_projects
================

The arduino IDE has a preference for how projects are organized, so this repo serves to support that until I have a project worthy of git submodules.

two main project subcategories are here:

 * prank phone: Code for the teensy 3.0 w/ audio board so it can detect an off hook receiver, play dial tone, dtmf, and wav file.
 * spinner/combolock/timer: projects using the [SparkFun RingCoder](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11040) and the RingCoder library I'm working on.
